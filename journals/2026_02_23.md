- # Meeting Tax Compliance End user Address
	- Organizer : Teodore Sotirov
	- ## Discussed
		- End customer data needs to be harmonized.
			- Everything is synced between systems so data should be harmonized
			- End customer tax ID will be added soon.
		- End customer address is important to define the correct tax
			- XVS creates an end customer ID per address
				- These ID's are also stored in the harmonized data as a separate entity under the harmonized end customer.
				- End customer will become a business partner in SAP
					- How will it become unique ?
						- Example 1 single Everest EU ID
							- Address 1 - XVS ID 1
							- Address 2 - XVS ID 2
						- From a design perspective we have to wait for Pradip Sutar on the design.
							- Pradip is still waiting for an answer on some of his questions.
