# Meeting C9 Multicurrency - Connectors, FX rates & Usage file processing
	- ## **1. Purpose of the Meeting**
	  
	  The group met to discuss required changes to vendor connectors for C9 multicurrency enablement, specifically for Canada.
	  
	  The current blocker: **Connectors generate usage files in Connect’s default marketplace currency instead of the vendor’s billing currency**, causing issues for migration to multicurrency, XVS 3.0, and SAP.
	  
	  ---
	- ## **2. Key Points Discussed**
	- ### **2.1 Core Requirement**
		- **Usage files must be generated in the vendor’s billing currency**, not Connect’s default currency.
		- Connect already supports multiple marketplace currencies, but default remains the local currency (CAD for Canada).
		  
		  ---
	- ## **3. Vendor-by-Vendor Analysis**
		- ### **3.1 Microsoft Azure**
			- Azure pricing is always in USD, but **billing currency varies by country** (e.g., CAD in Canada, INR in India).
			- Azure provides pricing and consumption values **in both the pricing currency (USD) and billing currency**.
			- Result: **No issue for Canada**—Azure provides consumption in CAD, which matches Connect’s marketplace currency.
			- Outcome: **Epic for Azure can be closed.**
			  
			  ---
		- ### **3.2 Acronis**
			- Uncertainty on whether Acronis bills Ingram in USD or CAD.
			- Acronis currently applies its own FX conversion before uploading files.
			- Ingram requires:
				- If invoiced in USD → usage files must be in USD (so Ingram can apply FX).
				- If invoiced in CAD → usage files should be in CAD.
			- Actions:
				- TODO [[Ernie Hannaford (Acronis)]] Tim H. will confirm with Acronis on Thursday: ?
				  DEADLINE: <2026-02-26 Thu 18:00>
					- Their actual billing currency for Canada.
					- What currency they provide in consumption files.
					- Need Acronis contact for ongoing discussions.
					  
					  ---
		- ### **3.3 AWS (Most Complex Vendor)**
			- This vendor represents **the largest set of issues**.
			- ### **Current Behavior**
				- AWS provides usage/consumption always in USD.
				- AWS may bill the same market using **different legal entities**:
					- AWS Inc.
					- AWS Canada
					- In some countries, even 3+ entities (example: UK).
			- ### **FX Conversion Challenges**
				- AWS uses *daily FX rates* to convert USD to local currency when invoicing.
				- Connect supports only *one FX rate per month*, requiring someone to manually update the FX table.
				- Long-term requirement: support **multiple FX rates per month/day** to match AWS billing.
			- ### **Future Migration Complications**
				- Canada will support **both CAD and USD reseller accounts**.
				- This requires:
					- Splitting usage files into two output files (CAD + USD).
					- Bypassing FX for USD accounts.
					- Applying Connect FX for CAD accounts.
			- ### **File Segmentation Approach**
				- AWS supplemental file identifies the **functional currency per payer account**.
				- This allows segmentation:
					- Functional currency = CAD → Convert via Connect FX
					- Functional currency = USD → Bypass Connect FX and pass USD to SAP
			- ### **Legal Entity Complexity**
				- Each billing legal entity should map to a distinct SAP purchasing vendor.
				- XVS must be able to route charges properly:
					- Not always tied to “product type” (service vs marketplace)
					  
					  → Observed inconsistencies mean simple product-based splitting won’t work.
				- ### **Action**
					- A dedicated follow-up session is required, including:
						- Tim A., Tim H., both Diegos (Spain), Teodor, and Wenny.
					- Meeting likely to be held **Friday or next Monday** due to team availability.
					  
					  ---
		- ## **3.4 Google Cloud (GCP)**
			- Appears similar to Azure:
			  
			  Billing aligns with marketplace currency.
			- No immediate issues identified; needs final confirmation.
			  
			  ---
	- ## **4. Additional Notes**
		- Need alignment with SAP:
			- Each AWS billing entity must map to a unique vendor record.
		- Mexico considerations raised as precedent:
			- Dual currency (USD + MXN) handling is supported by Connect.
		- Consolidated AWS billing will eventually be phased out → more complexity with multiple payer accounts and FX dates.
		  
		  ---
	- ## **5. Decisions / Agreements**
		- **Azure Epic will be closed**.
		- **Acronis investigation pending** (Tim’s Thursday call).
		- **AWS requires deeper technical and business discussion** → schedule follow-up.
		- **GCP likely OK**, confirm next call.
		  
		  ---
	- ## **6. Next Steps**
		- **Tim (Huygen)** to clarify Acronis billing + consumption currency and share contacts.
		- **Wenny** to share AWS entity recording to the broader group.
		- **Schedule detailed AWS & GCP session** after Acronis update.
		- **Investigate AWS entity-to-SAP vendor mapping strategy**.
		- **For AWS future phase:**
			- Implement daily FX support in Connect or alternate mechanism.
			- Enable USD payer accounts in SAP and usage flow segmentation.
