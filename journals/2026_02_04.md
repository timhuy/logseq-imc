- # Meeting [[GPE weekly working sessions]]
	- ## Discussed
		- **Summary: Global Platform Enablement Weekly Working Session – Feb 4, 2026**
		  
		  This session focused heavily on **GDE (Global Discount Engine)** progress, 2026 goals, onboarding strategy, and broader platform alignment across teams and regions.
		- ---
		- **1. 2026 GDE Goals & Expectations**
			- **Primary 2026 goal:**
			  All **vendor discounts** for **C9 (US, Canada, Mexico, Miami Export + EMEA C5)** must run through **GDE** by year‑end.
			- **Not all vendors will reach full automation.**
				- Auto send and auto quote depend on:
					- Vendor data quality
					- Vendor capabilities (API/XML/email, etc.)
					- Complexity of programs
					- Country requirements and customer experience
			- **Three GDE onboarding phases:**
				- **GDE Onboarding** – Vendor discounts loaded in GDE
				- **Auto Quote** – quote created automatically in CRM
				- **Auto Send** – quote automatically sent to reseller contact
		- ---
		- **2. EMEA Goal: 20 Vendors in 60 Days**
			- EMEA's initial target: onboard **20 vendors within 60 days** once pending GDE enhancements for Vendor Debit Desk (VDD) are delivered and live.
			- Clock only starts after enhancements go to production.
		- ---
		- **3. Clarifying C9 Countries**
			- C9 =
			- **US, Canada, Mexico, Miami Export**
			- **C5 EMEA:** Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France
		- ---
		- **4. Not All Vendors Will Be Full Auto Quote/Auto Send**
			- Many vendors don’t send enough structured data for full automation.
			- Auto-send often blocked when:
				- Vendor doesn’t provide customer contact
				- Complex configuration validation required
				- Shipping charges must be added manually
			- Countries must own vendor engagement to close data gaps.
		- ---
		- **5. Value of Each Phase**
		- Even without auto quoting:
			- GDE **replaces local tools** (COG, COP, SBO, etc.) → huge global standardization win
			- Centralized global reporting and visibility
			- Faster deployment of enhancements
			- Auto quote saves ~7–8 minutes per quote
			- Auto send saves an additional ~3–5 minutes
			  
			  ---
		- **6. Self‑Service & VCAF (Vendor & Customer Agnostic Framework)**
			- VCAF = parsing tool enabling ingestion of vendor files in any format (Excel/PDF/XML/email).
				- Business users can **self-train** parsing through:
					- **VAPT** (Vendor Agnostic Parsing Tool UI)
					- Auto-quote configurator
				- Goal: Non‑technical teams maintain vendor configurations without engineering.
				- Monitoring and alerting improvements are in progress so failures are detected proactively.
		- ---
		- **7. Onboarding & Lots/Waves**
			- Vendors grouped into **lots/waves** based on complexity.
			- Two main tracks:
				- **VDD (EMEA equivalent of COG)**: responsible for GDE onboarding & parsing
				- **Country-led automation teams**: define requirements for auto-quote and auto-send
			- Standard onboarding should accelerate once key Feb enhancements release.
		- ---
		- **8. US Progress & Country Ownership**
			- US is the model for mature deployment:
				- Tracks addressable vendors, onboarding pipeline, performance by vendor
				- Owns prioritization, requirements, and maintenance
			- Other countries expected to adopt the same owner-led model.
		- ---
		- **9. XVS (Subscriptions Platform) Critical Update**
			- Finance issued strict requirements before new vendors rollout can continue:
				- **Accuracy + completeness** of data
				- **3 consecutive months of clean billing (no errors)**
				- **Critical issue list** must be resolved
			- If issues fix by end of Feb, earliest possible new onboarding = **May**.
			- EU rollout of XVS 3.0 (SAP PS1) is on hold until US stability is proven.
		- ---
		- **10. New Squad Structure for 2026 Priorities**
			- Squads formed across Product, Engineering, Data, and Enablement for:
				- **Touchless Quoting**
				- **Self-Serve Ordering**
				- **Subscriptions**
				- **Post‑Sales / OST**
				- **Cost-to-Serve**
				- **Back Office Modernization**
			- These squads have **daily stand-ups** and are aligning on **Q1 goals**, prioritization, and end-to-end visibility.
			- Leadership workshops will occur in California the week of Feb 16 to finalize operational alignment.
		- ---
		- **11. X4A Unified Support Update**
			- US **Unified Support** goes live tomorrow.
			- X4C rollout expected two weeks later.
			- Experience in US will now be parity-plus to Level 0 Support Model which will enable us to decommission it
		-
	- ## Next Steps
		- Weekly sessions will continue.
		- Team will vote on upcoming deep-dive topics.
		- One-pagers will be shared summarizing workflows and expectations.
		- Gabby to present Unified Support updates next Wednesday.
